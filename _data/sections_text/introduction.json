The Sacred Harp is also the name of the book we sing from.\n\n**Our singing group in Durham is friendly and open to everyone.** We don't rehearse or perform. No-one's in charge. Everyone just turns up and sings for their own enjoyment. **You don't need to be able to read music or have a \"good\" voice to come along.**"
