  "text": "[Sacred Harp](#more-information) is a **communal folk hymn singing** tradition from the United States. The Sacred Harp is also the name of the book we sing from.\n\n**Our singings are friendly and open to all.** We aren't a choir because we don't rehearse or perform and no-one's in charge. Everyone just sings for their own enjoyment. **You don't need to be able to read music yet or have a \"good\" voice to come along.**"
