    <strong>Our singings are friendly and open to all.</strong> We aren't a choir because we don't rehearse or perform and no-one's in charge. Everyone just sings for their own enjoyment.<strong> You don't need to be able to read music yet or have a "good" voice to come along.</strong> Singers of all religions and none are welcome.
